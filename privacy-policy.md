# Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** 12/05/2025

This Privacy Policy describes how we ("Developer") handles information when using this personal software tool to access QuickBooks Online (QBO) APIs.

## 1. Who Uses This App

This app is a private tool used only by the Developer to access their own QuickBooks Online account. It is **not** provided to the general public and has no external end users.

## 2. Information Collected

The app may access the following information from the Developer’s QuickBooks Online account via the QBO APIs:

- Accounting and financial records
- Customer, vendor, and transaction data
- Other data made available through the QuickBooks Online API

The app may also store:

- OAuth access tokens and refresh tokens
- Configuration such as company ID and environment (sandbox/production)

## 3. How Information Is Used

The information accessed via the app is used solely to:

- Read and/or update the Developer’s own QuickBooks Online data
- Automate accounting or reporting tasks for the Developer

The app does **not** sell, rent, or share this information with third parties.

## 4. Data Storage

Any data or tokens stored by the app are kept locally on the Developer’s machine (for example, in configuration files, environment variables, or a local database). No data is intentionally stored on any external server controlled by the Developer.

QuickBooks Online and Intuit may store and process data according to their own terms and privacy policies.

## 5. Third Parties

The app communicates with:

- **Intuit / QuickBooks Online** APIs, to access and modify accounting data

No other third-party services are used for storing or processing QuickBooks data, except as explicitly configured by the Developer.

## 6. Security

The Developer takes reasonable steps to protect access tokens and local configuration, such as limiting access to the machine and using secure storage where possible. However, no method of electronic storage is 100% secure.

## 7. Your Choices

Because this is a personal tool, the only "user" is the Developer. The Developer can:

- Revoke the app’s access from the QuickBooks Online account
- Delete local configuration files and stored tokens
- Stop using or uninstall the app at any time

## 8. Changes to This Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. The "Last updated" date above will reflect the most recent version.
